# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN with Inception Bottleneck
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with an Inception Bottleneck architecture using PyTorch. The networks are trained to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving a final accuracy of 91.6%.

## Files in the Repository
### training.ipynb:

This Jupyter notebook contains the code for training a CNN models with Inception Bottleneck on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model definition, training loop, and evaluation metrics.

### training_complex_model.ipynb:

This notebook includes the implementation of the most complex CNN architecture. It follows the same structure as the training.ipynb notebook but with an advanced model design, aiming to improve classification performance. 

### result_notebook.ipynb:

This notebook presents the results of the trained models.

### training_adversarial_model.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook contains the code for training CNN models with an Inception Bottleneck on the CIFAR-10 dataset, incorporating added Gaussian noise.

### results_adversarial_training.ipynb

This notebook presents a comparison of the results between the model trained on adversarial images and the model trained on standard images.

## Performance

The best accuracy was achevied with the most complex model. 
Final Accuracy: 91.6%
